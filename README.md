## Description
Creating a chat room as part of our Node.js Workshop


## About the Node modules:
**Express** - Express is lightweight web application framework for Node.js. For this simple group chat, it is not necessary to use Express, but if you are planning to continue the development, this is nice to have.  

**Socket.io** - Socket.io is the key module in this tutorial which enables the realtime communication between the clients and the server.  

**EJS** - EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup for your front-end.
